# Password Checker
Using Python3, this python script can be used as a real world tool to securely check if your password has been hacked. It also shows you how many times it has been hacked so that you can get an idea of how common/uncommon your current password is.

## Requirements
- sys module: a built-in module of python and does not require installation
- requests module: will need to be installed as it's not a built-in module
    > pip install requests
- hashlib module:  will need to be installed as it's not a built-in module
    > pip install hashlib

## Instructions
To securely check your passwords, write them in the password.txt file, line by line.

Run the script in your terminal/cmd prompt by typing in python3 checkmypw.py

#### The output will show how often the password was hacked, allowing you to make the decision to change your password or not.
